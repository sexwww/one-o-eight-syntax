# One-O-Eight

One-O-Eight is a multi-schemes syntax. It comes with two backgrounds (white on
black or black on white), and a number of foreground schemes. All schemes are
based on five colours; the name one-o-eight comes from 108Â°, the internal angles
in a pentagon.

The schemes are:

1. *Bright*, five colors, good on *Light* background (default)
1. *Primary*, five colors, good on either background
1. *Shiny*, five colors, good on *Dark* background
1. *Calm*, green/blue/purple, good on *Light* background
1. *Forest*, green/blue/brown, good on either background

## Variants overview

All screenshots use the free [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack) font
at 15pt, which is *great*. All variants use a palette with five colors, and each
color has a lighter variant and a darker variant.
